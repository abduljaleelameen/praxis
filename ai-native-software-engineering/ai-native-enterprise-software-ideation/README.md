## Introduction: From Mainframes to AI Platforms

Business software has continually evolved through shifts in computing paradigms – from mainframe and client-server to internet, mobile, and cloud. In each era, core business use cases (CRM, ERP, etc.) remained largely the same, but the software was re-platformed to fit new devices and user expectations. For example, CRM systems moved from on-premises solutions like Siebel/PeopleSoft to cloud platforms like Salesforce, and similarly HR systems went from PeopleSoft to Workday. Traditionally, vendors would provide a **platform with standard functionality and APIs or toolkits for custom extensions**. However, the emerging AI era is poised to break this pattern. Rather than simply bolting AI onto existing tools, the next generation of enterprise software is expected to be **“AI-first”** – built with AI agents and generative models at the core of the user experience and customization process. In practice, this means future enterprise applications may ship *not only* with predefined features and an API, but with an **embedded AI-powered IDE or assistant** that lets customers modify screens, logic, and workflows through natural language. This could fundamentally change the business model: instead of lengthy development or configuration cycles, organizations will continuously shape their software via conversational AI interactions. Below, we explore how this paradigm might play out across major software categories (CRM, ERP, SCM, HCM, BI, etc.), along with examples of AI-driven development tools leading the way. We focus on large enterprises eager to capitalize on AI, with notes on implications for SMBs, and consider both business model and technical aspects.

## CRM (Customer Relationship Management)

CRM systems manage sales, marketing, and customer support processes. In the cloud era, CRMs like **Salesforce** and **HubSpot** established themselves as platforms – offering standard CRM modules with the ability to add custom fields, workflows, and integrations (often through scripting or third-party apps). In the AI-first era, CRM vendors are infusing generative AI to make customization and use more conversational and dynamic. For instance, Salesforce has introduced **Einstein GPT** and **Einstein for Developers**, which use Salesforce’s own LLM (CodeGen) to assist in development and automation. Developers or admins can now describe functionality in natural language and have the platform generate Apex code, Lightning web components, or configuration changes automatically. Early examples include **natural language to code** features that allow a user to *“Transform ideas into contextual and structured code using plain English”* – accelerating custom feature development in Salesforce. In practical terms, a Salesforce admin could soon say, *“Add a custom screen for account renewal with a button that triggers an approval workflow”*, and the system’s AI assistant would generate the necessary objects, forms, and Apex logic. Salesforce is already touting that generative AI can **“customize Salesforce faster and transform software development directly in your coding environment”**, acting as a conversational expert that suggests best-practice code snippets and fixes.

Other CRM providers are following suit. **HubSpot** has launched tools like ChatSpot (an AI chatbot interface for CRM tasks) and is likely to incorporate generative AI for configuration (e.g. creating reports or email sequences via chat). Microsoft’s Dynamics 365 CRM is integrating Copilot capabilities so that users can ask the CRM to draft an email or summarize pipeline insights in real time. The overarching vision is a **CRM that comes with an AI co-developer**: rather than writing low-level scripts or installing plugins, a business user can directly *ask* the CRM’s AI to adjust a process or add a data field, and the changes happen on the fly. This flips the traditional CRM business model – potentially reducing reliance on large implementation projects – and instead shifts value to **AI-driven adaptability**. Enterprise CRM vendors will likely monetize this by offering AI customization as a premium service or usage-based feature (e.g. buying “Einstein” or “Copilot” capacity). For enterprises, this promises faster time-to-value and more responsive tailoring of CRM workflows to business changes. For SMBs, an AI-customizable CRM could be transformative: a small company without an IT team could configure their CRM simply by conversing with it. Salesforce’s Meredith Schmidt noted that AI will help *“small businesses offer more personalized experiences… by maximizing their time and automating manual tasks”* – an AI-native CRM would embody that by automating much of the setup and customization that currently bogs down users.

## ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning)

ERP software (for finance, procurement, manufacturing, etc.) has historically been complex and often rigid. Cloud ERPs (like **SAP S/4HANA Cloud, Oracle Fusion Cloud, NetSuite**) improved flexibility with extension platforms and low-code tools. Now they are evolving into **AI-embedded ERP platforms**. According to industry observers, *“as of 2025, AI and ML capabilities are becoming core components of ERP systems – not just add-ons”*, with generative AI being exploited to reshape processes. This means AI is being built into the **core of ERP offerings** to assist with everything from data entry to customization.

**SAP** has introduced an AI copilot named **Joule** across its products. In development terms, SAP’s low-code environment **Build** now integrates Joule to help create extensions for S/4HANA via natural language and smart suggestions. SAP Build brings together classic pro-code (ABAP/Java) and low-code in a unified environment and uses generative AI for tasks like **code completion, business object generation, and even unit test creation**. In practice, an SAP developer can ask Joule, *“Generate a new custom field for material lead time and propagate it to the related form and report,”* and the system will draft the necessary extension, following SAP’s clean core guidelines. This is complemented by an **“extensibility wizard”** for in-app customizations (e.g. adding fields or logic with a few clicks) – essentially bridging the gap between end-user configuration and coding by using AI to guide the process. Oracle’s ERP and cloud platform have similar capabilities: **Oracle APEX 24.1** (a low-code tool often used to extend Oracle ERP) introduced an **APEX AI Assistant**, letting users *“generate, optimize, explain, or debug SQL and code”* via a conversational interface. Oracle’s assistant can even **build entire app pages from a description**, e.g. a user says they need a form to track IT assets, and it scaffolds the app screens and database tables accordingly. Microsoft’s Dynamics 365 and Power Platform are also integrating Copilot AI to help create **Power Apps** (custom business apps) by conversation – *“You don’t need to write any code or design screens. Copilot generates the app for you based on your description”*.

For ERP, the **business model implications** are significant. Vendors can differentiate by how open and powerful their AI customization capabilities are. They might charge for AI usage (e.g. per conversation or per code-generation) or bundle it into higher tiers. Enterprises benefit by drastically reducing the cost and time of tailoring the ERP to their needs – potentially replacing weeks of developer or consultant effort with a few guided AI prompts. This could reduce the need for armies of external ERP consultants (though new roles will emerge for **prompt engineering** and validation of AI outputs). However, enterprises will demand *governance and control* – thus we see features like SAP’s emphasis on **“full business context with security and governance”** even in AI-driven dev tools. SMBs that could never afford a heavily customized on-prem ERP might leverage an AI-driven cloud ERP to achieve 90% of the customization at a fraction of the cost, leveling the playing field. The vendor’s challenge will be ensuring these AI modifications are reliable and compliant with regulations (especially in finance) – possibly solved by **AI audit logs** and sandboxed testing of AI-generated code before deployment.

## SCM (Supply Chain Management) and Operations

Supply chain and operations software (including SCM, logistics, procurement, etc.) is another area poised for AI-native transformation. Modern supply chains generate massive data and require complex decision-making; AI has already been used for forecasting and optimization for years. The new twist is using **agentic AI and conversational interfaces** to customize and automate supply chain processes in real-time. Instead of a static system where planners manually adjust parameters or write scripts for each new business rule, future SCM platforms may include **AI agents** that automatically learn and execute tasks like reordering inventory, selecting suppliers, or rerouting shipments. In fact, experts note that *“AI agents can automate sourcing and supplier management… analyze performance data and handle nuanced decision-making across the supply chain”*.

Concretely, an **AI-driven SCM system** might let a user describe a new scenario or policy in plain language – for example, *“If any regional warehouse’s stock of Product X falls below 500 units and forecasted weekly demand exceeds 1000, automatically expedite a replenishment order from the nearest hub”*. The AI would translate that into the system’s workflow or rules, effectively acting as a supply chain co-pilot. Companies like Coupa envision *“agentic AI”* as a foundational part of supply chain design and management, not an afterthought. According to Coupa, **agentic AI** in supply chain can *“improve decision-making, automate complex tasks, improve efficiency, proactively identify risk, and make it easier for more teams to benefit from modeling”*. The key is that the AI agents are built into the supply chain platform from the ground up, rather than bolted on. For instance, a procurement system could come with an AI agent that learns a company’s purchasing patterns and negotiation tactics. Instead of a procurement officer manually customizing approval workflows or supplier scoring rules, they could simply instruct the agent with goals or constraints (*“Prioritize suppliers with lower carbon footprint for this category unless cost exceeds 5% premium”*) and the agent adapts the system’s logic accordingly.

The **business impact** is that supply chain software could move towards an *autonomous orchestration* model. Enterprises might subscribe to an SCM platform that continuously self-optimizes and customizes itself via AI – delivering resilience and efficiency gains. This changes the vendor’s value proposition: beyond providing features, they provide an AI that **learns the business**. Pricing might be tied to outcomes (cost savings achieved) or usage of AI-driven simulations and adjustments. SMBs, on the other hand, could benefit from **democratized intelligence** – a small manufacturer using an AI-SCM platform gets sophisticated optimization without hiring a demand planning team. However, trust and transparency will be crucial for adoption. We may see features like an AI “explainability” mode: when the supply chain AI makes a change or suggestion, it explains in human terms why (e.g. citing data on lead times, costs). In summary, SCM software in the AI era becomes a **dynamic, learning system** that the user guides via high-level instructions, rather than a static system tweaked by low-level configuration.

## HCM (Human Capital Management)

HCM software handles HR, talent, and workforce management processes. In prior generations, HCM (e.g. **Workday**, **SAP SuccessFactors**, **Oracle HCM Cloud**) offered robust workflows for things like hiring, payroll, and performance reviews, with customization mainly through configuration settings or custom reports. Now, HCM vendors are positioning themselves as **AI platforms for people operations**. Workday, for example, explicitly markets itself as *“the AI platform for managing people, money, and **agents**”*, highlighting that its system is built “with AI at the core”. This has materialized in tools like **Workday AI Developer Copilot** and an **Agent framework**. Workday’s recently announced *AI Developer Toolset* includes an **Agent Gateway** (to integrate and manage various AI agents in HR/finance processes) and **AI Widgets** that can be embedded in the UI to provide generative AI assistance to end-users.

For customization, Workday’s **Extend** platform (which allows building custom apps on Workday) now comes with *Developer Copilot*, a conversational assistant that significantly speeds up coding and configuration tasks. A Workday developer can literally chat with the Copilot to *“generate app code snippets and data queries”* and get interactive recommendations for the best APIs to use. Common customizations – like creating a new report or an integration – can be initiated by simply asking (e.g. *“Generate a report of turnover by department with a trend graph”*). The Copilot will produce the needed query and report template, which the developer can then refine. Similarly, unit test generation and even documentation summarization can be done via prompts. This dramatically lowers the effort to tailor Workday to unique requirements. Workday is also enabling HR professionals to leverage AI without coding: for instance, an HR admin might use a natural language **Prompt Builder** (Salesforce has a similar concept) to create an AI-driven service query in Workday’s help chatbot (like *“How do I update my 401k contribution?”* – and the admin configures that by describing the answer steps, with AI filling in the details).

From a business perspective, **enterprises adopting AI-rich HCM** can become more agile in managing people processes. New policies or organizational changes can be reflected in the system via quick AI-assisted adjustments rather than waiting for the next quarterly update or expensive consulting. Workday’s introduction of an **Agent Partner Network** also hints at a new ecosystem: third-party AI agents that can plug into Workday (for example, an AI specialized in coaching employees or analyzing survey sentiment). This suggests HCM might shift to a platform-plus-marketplace model, where revenue comes from both the core software and the add-on AI skills/agents customers use. SMB-oriented HCM solutions will likely integrate general AI services (such as leveraging OpenAI via APIs) to offer “virtual HR assistants” that help craft job descriptions, answer employee questions, or customize onboarding workflows without dedicated HR staff. An SMB using, say, Gusto or BambooHR might soon get an AI that automatically customizes their HR templates and processes based on best practices, all through a chat interface.

## BI and Analytics (Business Intelligence)

Business Intelligence tools (for analytics, reporting, dashboards) are undergoing one of the most visible AI-driven changes. Traditionally, BI required skilled analysts to define data models, write SQL or use drag-and-drop tools to create charts. The next generation of **BI is conversational and AI-powered** – turning natural language questions into queries and visualizations automatically. Many modern BI platforms are adding **Copilot-like features**: Microsoft **Power BI** now has an AI Copilot that can build and modify reports via chat, Salesforce **Tableau** announced *Tableau GPT and Tableau Pulse* for conversational insights, and startups like ThoughtSpot have **Sage** (LLM integration for search). Pyramid Analytics dubs this trend “Generative BI (GenBI)” and shows that users can *“create a complex dashboard on the fly… with just text or speech”*, simply by describing their requirements. The AI handles all the underlying data retrieval and chart creation steps, delivering a fully functional dashboard in seconds.

&#x20;*Illustration: An example of an AI-driven BI interface where a user can conversationally generate insights and dashboards. Such generative BI tools fuse large language models with analytics, enabling quick, on-the-fly creation of data visualizations and reports.*

Not only does generative AI build the visuals, but it also assists in explaining insights. A user might ask, *“Why did sales dip in the Northeast in Q3?”*, and the BI assistant could highlight contributing factors (using patterns it finds in the data, like a specific product shortage or regional market trend) and even generate a written summary. This shifts BI from a passive tool to an **active analyst** role. The platform becomes both the creator and interpreter of analytics. Microsoft’s Power BI Copilot, for instance, can generate DAX formulas or suggest additional data to include, based on the user’s questions. BI vendors are thus selling not just software but **insight-as-a-service** – potentially charging for AI query processing or offering premium tiers that allow unlimited AI Q\&A on your data.

For enterprises, this can greatly accelerate decision-making and **data democratization**. Business users who aren’t fluent in BI tools can simply ask questions and get answers, reducing dependence on data analysts for every new report. It’s a productivity boost (as the Medium Power BI community noted, what took days of back-and-forth can now be done in minutes) and also a way to surface trends that might be overlooked. However, data governance becomes even more critical – the AI needs to respect security (showing data only to authorized users) and accuracy (avoiding “hallucinating” insights that aren’t actually supported by data). We see vendors addressing this by connecting LLMs directly to verified data models (as Pyramid does, working off live data sources with an abstraction layer) and by providing **multi-LLM strategies** so companies can choose a model they trust. For SMBs, AI-driven BI could be a game-changer because it removes the need to hire a full BI team – even a non-technical founder can interact with their data via chat and get actionable insights. Indeed, Gartner predicts *“superapps”* with unified experiences will rise, and having BI seamlessly integrated via an AI interface in those apps will streamline operations for smaller businesses. In sum, the business model for BI may evolve to value **answers and storytelling** over the traditional licensing of a visual analytics tool – success will be measured by how quickly and accurately the software can inform decisions using AI.

## Other Categories and Emerging Trends

Virtually every category of enterprise software stands to be reinvented with AI-driven customization. A few notable examples include:

* **IT Service Management (ITSM) and Workflows:** Platforms like ServiceNow are embedding generative AI to help create and optimize workflows. ServiceNow’s **Now Assist for Workflow** can take a user’s description of a process and generate a functioning automated workflow or RPA (Robotic Process Automation) bot. For instance, in the latest ServiceNow release, a developer can simply describe an automation (e.g. *“When a new hire is added in HR system, open accounts in all IT systems and send a welcome email”*) and Now Assist will generate the bot logic and integration steps in seconds. A ServiceNow blog demonstrated *“text-to-bot”* functionality where *“Now Assist for RPA allows developers to generate bot logic and components simply by describing the desired automation in natural language”*. This dramatically cuts down development time for IT workflows from weeks to potentially hours. Business-wise, this enables ServiceNow to upsell AI capabilities and make their platform stickier – customers who quickly build many custom automations via AI will be deeply invested. It also broadens the user base: more employees (even non-coders) can create simple workflows, which for SMBs could mean automating tasks without hiring a specialist. Competitors like Atlassian (with Jira Service Management) or other ITSM tools are likely to follow suit with AI-assisted configuration.

* **Marketing and CX (Customer Experience) Software:** Many marketing automation platforms (e.g. Adobe Marketing Cloud, HubSpot marketing hub, Mailchimp) are adding AI to help generate content (emails, ads) and even to optimize campaign logic. The next step could be AI agents that *act as your marketing ops team* – adjusting customer segments, triggers, and workflows on the fly. For example, a marketing manager could say, *“Set up a 3-email campaign for customers who bought Product A but haven’t logged in recently, offering a refresher webinar”*, and the system would configure the segment, craft the emails with appropriate tone, and schedule the workflow. While current products already use AI for content personalization, AI-driven customization would mean the software itself suggests new campaign structures or automatically A/B tests and refines them. This could be packaged as “AI Marketing Assistant” subscriptions. SMB-focused tools are already moving here (e.g. Mailchimp has a content optimizer, HubSpot has an AI content assistant). The technical challenge is ensuring the AI truly understands marketing strategy – we may see foundation models fine-tuned on marketing performance data to become experts in what workflows yield high conversion.

* **Industry-Specific and Long-tail Software:** Think of software like EHR systems in healthcare, PLM (Product Lifecycle Management) in manufacturing, or CAD software in engineering. These domains have specialized workflows. AI offers a way to **simplify customization in highly regulated or complex domains**. For example, a hospital using an EHR could use an AI assistant to create a new form or decision support rule by saying, *“When a patient has diabetes and is on medication X, prompt the clinician to check liver function tests every 3 months.”* The EHR’s AI would translate that into an automated alert rule in the system. Some EHR vendors are exploring GPT-based helpers for documentation (reducing manual data entry for doctors), but we can expect them to also provide configuration help (since hospital IT teams often need to create custom order sets or compliance checks). In manufacturing, a PLM or MES (Manufacturing Execution System) could let engineers describe a new production workflow and have the system simulate and implement it. Many of these industry apps have small user bases and traditionally require lots of vendor consulting for customization – AI could make customers more self-sufficient, which might force vendors to adapt their business models (possibly shifting from service revenue to higher software subscription fees that include AI tooling).

* **Developer Tools and IDEs:** It’s worth noting that the **software development process itself** is changing due to AI. Enterprises often build custom software on top of or adjacent to their enterprise software. Tools like **Replit**, **GitHub Copilot**, **Cursor.ai**, **Amazon CodeWhisperer**, etc., are enabling faster coding with AI pair-programmers. This trend influences enterprise software delivery too: internal developer teams can use these AI coding assistants to build unique extensions or entirely new applications far more rapidly. For forward-looking enterprises, adopting these AI-assisted dev tools is now part of the strategy to stay agile. We are even seeing **domain-specific IDEs** emerge that could align with enterprise platforms – for example, **IBM has AI-powered code assistants for legacy modernization (COBOL to Java)**, and niche products exist for Salesforce (Einstein in VSCode) or SAP (ABAP in Visual Studio Code with AI). These lower the barrier to customizing and integrating systems, and thus complement the vision of enterprise apps that are open to on-the-fly changes. The enterprise IT department of the near future might maintain a library of *in-house AI models* trained on their codebase and best practices, essentially creating an AI assistant that knows the company’s entire software landscape. This could be a proprietary advantage (and indeed, some large banks and firms are reportedly training models on their internal code).

## Examples of AI-Driven Development Platforms and Their Focus

To better understand the landscape, here is a look at several prominent AI-driven development tools – effectively **custom IDEs or platforms augmented with AI** – and what kinds of software they target:

* **Lovable.dev:** An AI-powered app builder focused on full-stack web applications. Lovable provides a chat-based IDE where users describe the app they want (e.g. “a blog website with Next.js”) and it generates the project structure, frontend code (React + Tailwind CSS), and can even set up integrations like Stripe payments via prompts. It’s like a specialized IDE for web app prototyping and development with AI as a co-engineer. This tool is well-suited for startups or small teams who need to spin up MVPs and internal tools quickly. Users can refine the output by instructing the AI to adjust UI elements or logic, and Lovable will regenerate or edit the code accordingly. Essentially, it turns natural language requirements into working web apps, targeting use cases that normally require a full-stack developer.

&#x20;*Example: Lovable.dev’s AI IDE interface generating a Next.js blog application from a prompt. On the left, the user provides requirements via chat (“Create a blog app with Next.js…” along with desired design elements), and on the right, Lovable generates a live preview and code for the app. Such AI-driven IDEs enable developers to build and customize applications through conversation, significantly accelerating the development process.*

* **Cursor.ai:** A specialized **AI-first code editor** (a fork of VS Code) that integrates a powerful AI assistant throughout the coding workflow. Cursor is general-purpose (not tied to a specific app type) but is particularly useful for working on codebases with speed and ease. It offers features like **intelligent autocompletion, code generation for boilerplate, and in-editor chat for refactoring or debugging**. For example, a developer can highlight a function and ask Cursor in plain English to optimize it or explain a bug, and it will provide suggestions within the editor. Cursor excels at helping with repetitive coding tasks (it can scaffold CRUD APIs, suggest integration code for known APIs, etc.), essentially acting as an **AI pair programmer** deeply integrated into your IDE. This is valuable for enterprise developers who might be extending an ERP via code or building custom microservices – the AI can reference the entire codebase to answer questions like “Where is the tax calculation logic defined?”. The focus of Cursor is boosting developer productivity for any kind of software development, with an emphasis on *autonomous or agentic features* (e.g. it can run an “Agent” to handle multi-step refactors on its own). Its business model is subscription-based, targeting professional developers and software teams.

* **Replit Ghostwriter:** **Replit** is an online coding platform and IDE popular for its ease of use and instant hosting. Ghostwriter is Replit’s AI assistant that helps generate and complete code. Replit’s focus is on making software creation accessible – it supports a plethora of languages and one-click deployments. With Ghostwriter, even a novice can get code suggestions, ask the AI to build small apps or scripts, and deploy them right from the browser. This tool targets a broad range: hobbyists, educators, and startup developers. It’s especially useful for **rapid prototyping** and for SMBs that may not have a full development environment setup – one can log into Replit, describe what they need (like a Python script to process sales data), and the AI will help create it. By integrating AI, Replit’s business model moves toward charging for AI capability usage (free basic tier, paid for advanced).

* **Bolt (bolt.new):** Bolt is an example of a new breed of “agentic IDEs” that StackBlitz introduced. It’s designed for *“AI-first software development”*, meaning it heavily automates tasks like generating app boilerplate, running tests, setting up CI/CD pipelines, etc., using AI agents. Bolt reportedly achieved significant user traction, indicating demand for such tools. The target apps for Bolt are full-stack web applications (similar to Lovable, it can create a complete app from a single prompt) and it emphasizes tight integration with cloud deployment – so a developer can go from idea to cloud-hosted solution quickly. Bolt’s key feature list – AI code generation, smart debugging, and even **autonomous agents that handle repetitive tasks** – shows it aims to **reduce manual effort across the software lifecycle**. This could appeal to enterprise dev teams trying to shorten release cycles, as well as solo devs. Monetization likely comes from cloud usage and premium features.

* **GitHub Copilot & AWS CodeWhisperer:** These are AI coding assistants integrated into popular IDEs (VS Code, JetBrains, etc.) rather than standalone platforms. They use generative AI to suggest the next lines of code or even entire functions as you type. Copilot, powered by OpenAI’s models, has become a go-to tool for many developers, supporting all kinds of software projects. CodeWhisperer, similarly, is tailored to Amazon’s ecosystem and offers code suggestions (with an emphasis on AWS SDK usage, for example). These tools focus on **increasing individual developer efficiency** and reducing syntax drudgery. For enterprises, GitHub offers Copilot for Business which addresses IP and privacy concerns (important for closed-source code). These assistants don’t target a specific “app type” – they are language-agnostic – but they shine in common programming tasks (e.g., writing unit tests, boilerplate code, data structure manipulation). Their success (Copilot reportedly can produce a significant portion of code for some users) has validated the market, and their business model is straightforward: subscription per user. They pave the way for acceptance of AI in day-to-day development, making it easier for enterprise software vendors to justify AI-based customization in their platforms as well.

Each of these tools underscores the trend that **software development itself is becoming more interactive and AI-driven**. The line between “end-user customizing an app” and “developer writing code” is blurring: with natural-language IDEs, a savvy business user could potentially create or modify enterprise software without formal programming, while developers leverage the same AI to work at a higher abstraction level (focusing on logic and design, letting AI handle syntax and plumbing). This democratization of development is key to the future vision where enterprise software comes with “custom IDEs” for customers – those IDEs might not look like Visual Studio, but rather like chat windows or visual prompt studios embedded in the application.

## Enterprise and SMB Implications; Business Model Shifts

The adoption of AI-driven software customization will impact how both large enterprises and SMBs procure and use software:

* **For Enterprises:** Large organizations will gain agility in software adaptation. Instead of waiting for vendor releases or lengthy dev cycles, they can tweak their systems almost in real-time via AI assistants. However, they will also demand **robust controls**. We can expect enterprise software to offer features like AI change management – e.g., the AI might propose a change, but it goes through an approval workflow or simulation before going live. Enterprises will likely maintain *“digital guardrails”* – perhaps setting policies on what the AI can or cannot do (for example, “AI cannot delete data fields without human approval” or must comply with audit logging). Vendors have started addressing this by introducing **AI governance frameworks** (e.g., Workday ensuring all AI decisions are documented, or SAP letting customers choose which LLMs to use for data privacy). In terms of business model, enterprises might end up paying a premium for unlimited AI customization capabilities or for hosting a dedicated instance of the AI (to keep their data and prompts secure). There may also be new roles on the enterprise side: **AI solution managers** or **prompt engineers** embedded in business units to interface with these AI IDEs, ensuring they produce the desired outcomes. Crucially, as AI handles simpler coding tasks, human experts can focus on higher-level architecture and strategy – so enterprise IT teams might shrink in some areas but grow in demand for system design, AI oversight, and integration work (since connecting multiple AI-augmented systems will be an art of its own).

* **For SMBs:** Small and midsize businesses stand to benefit immensely because AI-driven platforms lower the expertise barrier. Many SMBs skip advanced software customization today due to cost or lack of IT talent. With generative AI, the local retail shop owner might customize their e-commerce or CRM by themselves via chat, or a small manufacturer might set up an inventory reorder rule without hiring a specialist. This could make SMBs more competitive with larger firms in how they use technology. On the flip side, SMBs will need to trust these AI systems (which can be challenging if they don’t have an IT department to validate changes). To cater to SMBs, vendors might bundle AI features in lower-tier offerings as a differentiation. We might see more **freemium models** where the base software is affordable, but advanced AI capabilities (designing complex workflows, generating sophisticated analyses) cost extra or require a usage-based plan. SMB-focused products will also emphasize simplicity and ready-made templates: the AI might start with pre-trained knowledge of common small business needs (like “appointment scheduling app” or “basic CRM for a 5-person sales team”) so that with one prompt the SMB gets a near-complete solution.

* **Business Models & Vendor Strategy:** The rise of AI-customizable software will force vendors to rethink how they deliver value. If customers can self-service many changes via AI, the **professional services revenue** for vendors and partners might decrease. In response, some vendors may charge specifically for AI usage (e.g., a certain number of AI operations or tokens included per month, then an overage fee) – similar to how cloud providers charge for compute. Others might use AI capabilities as an upsell to higher subscription tiers (e.g., “Salesforce Enterprise includes 50 Einstein GPT credits per user/month, but Unlimited includes 500”). We also see the possibility of *app marketplaces evolving into model marketplaces* – since if every application is customizable via AI, third parties might start selling prompt packs or fine-tuned mini-models that plug into the platform (as Workday’s Agent Network suggests). This opens new ecosystem opportunities: a consulting firm might encapsulate its industry knowledge into an AI agent that can be installed into the ERP to provide, say, optimized configuration for retail or healthcare, and they could sell that as a product rather than doing one-off projects.

Technically, ensuring **reliability and security** of AI-driven customization is a challenge that itself creates a business opportunity. Vendors that can advertise strong safety (like preventing an AI from introducing a bug that breaks your financials) will have an edge. Expect features such as *sandbox mode*, where AI-proposed changes run in a test environment first, or *AI explainability dashboards* that let IT admins review why the AI made certain code changes (Salesforce’s Code Analyzer integration with Einstein, for example, catches potential issues early). Vendors will also invest in fine-tuning AI on their domain: a CRM AI trained on millions of CRM configurations will likely perform better for CRM tasks than a general model, so we see Salesforce, SAP, Workday all creating domain-specific models (Salesforce’s CodeGen, SAP’s Joule, Workday’s Illuminate). This could lead to each major vendor having its own **foundation model moat**, which could tie customers more tightly to their ecosystem (because the AI that knows Salesforce best is Salesforce’s own, etc.).

In conclusion, the future of enterprise software will be defined by **fluidity and user-empowerment**. Instead of static SaaS products that require adaptation by humans, we will have adaptable software that molds itself to users’ needs through AI. Major categories like CRM, ERP, SCM, HCM, and BI are already on this path – early offerings show how AI can generate code, workflows, and insights on demand, and even coordinate multiple software “agents” to get complex jobs done. Enterprises that embrace these capabilities stand to innovate faster and differentiate their operations (since they can tweak software continually to optimize processes), while SMBs can access a level of sophistication in software use that previously required enterprise IT budgets. From a business model perspective, software companies will transition to selling **platforms plus intelligence** – where the ongoing AI-driven customization and improvement of the software is as much the product as the software’s initial features. Those vendors who truly bake AI into the core (and not just as a “wrapper” or add-on) are likely to lead the next era of enterprise software, delivering unprecedented flexibility and productivity to their customers.

**Sources:** The analysis above draws on industry reports and announcements from leading vendors and experts. Salesforce’s introduction of generative AI for developers demonstrates how **CRM customization is speeding up with conversational coding**. ERP trends compiled by NetSuite and others show that **AI/ML are becoming embedded, core parts of ERP systems** rather than optional extras. Supply chain experts (e.g., at Coupa) emphasize the role of **agentic AI in autonomously improving supply chain decisions**. Workday’s 2025 press release illustrates how **HCM is delivered as an AI platform with developer copilot and agent integration** for easier extensibility. BI evolution is captured by sources like Pyramid Analytics and Microsoft’s Power BI team, highlighting **conversational dashboard creation and AI insight generation**. We also referenced examples of AI IDEs (Lovable.dev, Cursor.ai, etc.) to underscore the capabilities of current AI-driven development tools. These sources collectively reinforce the picture of a new software paradigm: one where **the platform and the custom IDE merge, powered by AI**, to deliver business solutions that can be molded at the speed of thought.
