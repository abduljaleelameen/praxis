
## surveilr as the SQL-native AI Context and Data Middleware for Trustable Interactions

As AI-native systems evolve to serve B2B users with verifiable, document-grounded interactions and answers, there is a critical need for a middleware layer that does more than connect APIs or move data. We need a platform that **ingests**, **structures**, **stores**, and **serves** contextual, provenance-rich knowledge — ready for LLM grounding, citation, and audit.

That platform is [`surveilr`](https://www.surveilr.com/).

`surveilr` is the **[Resource Surveillance and Integration Engine](https://www.surveilr.com/)** that acts as both an **AI Data Middleware** and **AI Context Middleware**. It transforms traditional disconnected document stores, logs, SaaS tools, and enterprise systems (CRM, ERP, PLM, EHR, etc.) into a **uniform, SQL-queryable, provenance-enriched knowledge layer** that LLMs can safely draw from.

Unlike stateless data buses or document pipelines, `surveilr` is **stateful** — it maintains lineage, timing, and transformation metadata for every knowledge item ingested. And unlike vector databases or embedding stores, `surveilr` retains the raw, structured, and human-readable facts in a standardized format — which makes it ideal for grounding LLM interactions and answers with auditable citations.

We do not trust interactions and answers simply because an LLM says them with confidence. We trust them when:

* The source of the AI response or interaction or answer is clear
* The content matches what was written in an internal document
* The transformation process from source to response is inspectable

In our system architecture, trust does not begin with the LLM — it begins with the data layer. That is where `surveilr` excels:

* It captures structured and unstructured enterprise content and makes it queryable via SQL
* It preserves metadata, authorship, and file lineage which is queryable via SQL
* It makes all content and meta data queryable by SQL or can generate AI context bundles using SQL queries
* It allows document-grounded citations to be enforced downstream in the AI output

| **Uniform Resource Schema**      | Transforms messy, diverse files (PDFs, Excel, EHRs, etc.) into a standardized schema that AI can consume   |
| **Capturable Executables (CEs)** | Let teams write scripts per document to extract or generate data, preserving knowledge provenance          |
| **Contextual State Tracking**    | Maintains timestamped, structured, version-aware records that help determine freshness and authority       |
| **Edge-Based Processing**        | Processes data where it originates — minimizing exposure of sensitive content before it’s contextualized |
| **SQL-First Access**             | Makes all context LLM-ready via SQL, allowing clean joins, scoping, chunking, and ontology-based filtering |
| **Anonymization + Redaction**    | Ensures private content can be included in grounding without leaking PII or sensitive fields               |

### Integration with the AI Prompting Layer

Once documents and data sources are ingested via `surveilr`, they can be fed into:

* Context Bundles generated via SQL for AnythingLLM or other orchestrators
* Markdown representations with frontmatter metadata, auto-generated or authored manually
* Markdown content querying via SQL
* Markdown frontmatter/metadata querying via SQL

Using `surveilr`, we remove guesswork from AI prompting. We can write prompts like:

> "Based on the most recent onboarding policy for sales staff, what are the conditions for early access to benefits? Provide section title and effective date."

Because the data is already structured in `surveilr`'s SQLite RSSDs and mapped to Markdown chunks or SQL queries, we can enforce:

* Output must cite the document’s `onboarding_policy.md` chunk `sec-3.paragraph-2` (using Markdown queries in SQL or querying frontmatter)
* Answer must reflect only the current version or explicitly include historical context

### Beyond RAG: surveilr + Graphs and Ontologies

Where appropriate, `surveilr`-stored resources can be:

* Indexed into vector databases (with provenance-preserving chunking)
* Related via OWL ontologies (created with Protégé)
* Mapped into knowledge graphs for advanced semantic filtering and Graph-RAG workflows

This allows our architecture to evolve from simple semantic similarity to structured factual grounding based on:

* Document clauses
* Organizational taxonomy
* Role-based data views
* Temporal relevance

This layered design enables us to move from “question answering” to “position defending” — where an LLM doesn’t just answer a query but explains the policy lineage, references supporting material, and knows when it cannot answer due to lack of source coverage.

### surveilr = Grounding Infrastructure

In an AI-native system built for trust, `surveilr` plays the role that traditional middleware never could:

> It is the **grounding infrastructure** — turning disconnected enterprise data into structured, traceable, LLM-ready knowledge.

Without this grounding, hallucination is inevitable. With it, our AI systems become instruments of citation, clarity, and context — the opposite of opaque.

Every trustworthy answer begins with a trustable fact. And every trustable fact lives in `surveilr`.
